DESCR  =  single-row facility layout problem modeled as a quadratic linear ordering problem
   An instance of the single-row facility layout problem is formally
   defined by n one-dimensional facilities with given positive lengths
   and pairwise non-negative weights. The objective is to arrange the
   facilities so as to minimize the total weighted sum of the
   center-to-center distances between all pairs of facilities. This
   problem can be modeled as a quadratic objective over linear ordering
   variables.
