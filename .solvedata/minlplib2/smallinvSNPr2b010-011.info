APPLICATION  =  Portfolio Optimization
DESCR  =  Small Investor Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization
   This is a natural extension of the standard Markovitz Mean-Variance-Optimization
   (MVO) model by constraints for small investors. The variables in the standard
   Markovitz model determine which fraction of the investment is made in the
   repective assets. When the investment is bounded within a range that is not very
   much bigger than the prices of the assets, one has to take into account that
   each asset has a minimum unit of which only integer multiples can be traded,
   e.g. 1, 0.1, or 0.01. Hence, the optimization problem for the small investor has
   integer variables in addition to the budget constraints that define lower and
   upper bounds on the investment.
