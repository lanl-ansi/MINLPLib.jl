APPLICATION  =  Graph Partitioning
DESCR  =  This is a quadratic model for the graph partitioning problem. The
   graphs are taken from the publication of Ghaddar et al. We used 3
   parts of the partition to generate the quadratic instances. The model
   assigns each node to one of the three parts. Hence, the model is
   symmetric, which should probably be used in a solution algorithm.
