APPLICATION = Facility Location
DESCR = Probabilistic Facility Location and Assignment with Random Demand (given by 5000 scenarios), where 4 facilities can be opened anywhere in the Euclidean plane (distances are measured with the Manhattan (or L1) metric), the facilities are capacitated and each customer is served by a single facility.
    The objective is to minimize an upper-bound on the weighted total-distance (i.e., the sum of the product of the demand of each customer times the distance to the facility serving that customer) such that this bound is satisfied with a reliability level of 0.80.
