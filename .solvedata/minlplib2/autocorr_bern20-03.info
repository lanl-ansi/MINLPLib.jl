DESCR  =  degree-four model for low autocorrelated binary sequences
   This instance arises in theoretical physics. Determining a ground
   state in the so-called Bernasconi model amounts to minimizing a
   degree-four energy function over variables taking values in
   {+1,-1}. Here, the energy function is expressed in 0/1 variables. The
   model contains symmetries, leading to multiple optimum solutions.
