DESCR = A set of tri-axial ellipsoids, with given semi-axes, is to be packed into a rectangular box;
   its widths, lengths and height are subject to lower and upper bounds. We want to minimize the volume
   of this box and seek an overlap-free placement of the ellipsoids which can take any orientation.
