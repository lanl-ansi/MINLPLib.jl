DESCR = This model designs a vertically corrugated transverse bulkhead of an oil tanker.
   The objective is to design for minimum weight and meet stress, moment of inertia and plate thickness constraints.
   This version of ship corresponds to the current version of ship from the GAMS model library.
   It corresponds to the original version from the paper, plus an extra lower bound on variable x10.
