APPLICATION  =  Edge-crossing minimization in bipartite graphs
DESCR  =  edge-crossing minimization in bipartite graphs modeled as a quadratic linear ordering problem
   This instance is for the edge crossing minimization problem in a
   bipartite graph G. G has to be drawn in the plane so that the nodes of
   its two shores are placed on two parallel horizontal lines. The task
   is to minimize the number of edge crossings by permuting the order of 
   nodes on each layer, assuming that all edges are drawn as straight
   lines. The problem can be modeled as a quadratic objective over linear 
   ordering variables.
