DESCR  =  A simple MINLP with a feasible set described by a ball.
    The basic model over which these variations are made is:
    min  sum_i=1^n x_i
    s.t. sum_i=1^n (x_i - 0.5)^2 <= (n-1)/4
         x integer between -1 and 1.
    Obvisouly, this problem is infeasible and has no solution.
    It can be shown that any outer-approximation based method will need 2^n linear inequalities to show infeasibility, see reference.
    In this instance, the ball is slightly moved to contain the point 0.
