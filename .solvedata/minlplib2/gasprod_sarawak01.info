DESCR = Li et al. reformulated the natural gas production model of Selot et al. from a general
  MINLP to MIQCQP. The modeling files corresponding to these problems have been scaled in accordance
  with the design of Li et al. The 3 test cases are effectively the same
  problem with a different number of uncertain scenarios.
