APPLICATION = Gas Transmission
DESCR       = Given gas flow and pressure specifications at entries and exits of a realistic gas network, the problem is to find a feasible network flow or to prove that none exists.
     The data is based on a real-world network from the gas transport company Open Grid Europe GmbH.
     The network consists of 582 nodes, 278 pipes, 5 compressor stations, 23 control valve stations, 8 resistors, 26 valves, and 269 "short pipes".
     Compared to instance gastrans582_mild10, in this instance the nominations have been scaled to 95% of the flow amount, i.e., the supplied (discharged) amount of gas at every entry (exit) has been scaled by 0.95.
